+ fix civ bug
+ proper age list
+ turn off unequal ages
+ fix data save
+ optimize ai scripts
+ allow double-counting units if different civs
+ fix loser? bug
+ repeat for a minimum and maximum amount of tries
+ repeat until convergence reached
+ add re-engage micro
+ move to separate repo

--- report DE bug
- turn off all hit-and-run and avoid-projectile micro
- calculate unit strength difference + convergence for this
- time how long calculations take
- add ETA calculation
--- create separate ai to print costs of units
- set unit counts based on cost data
- weights for each resources
- weights take into account all civ bonuses
--- print formatted data to file
--- print final stats from loaded data
- load correct costs ratios from file
- add remaining civs
